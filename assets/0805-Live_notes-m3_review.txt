∑ = {C,A,G,T}, L = L = { w : w starts and ends with the same symbols; #G(w) ≤ 1; #G(w) + 1 = #A(w) + #C(w); if w starts with T then #T(w) % 2 = 1.} For example, TGCTCT ∈ L; CT4GT2C ∈ L; TGCTCTT ∉ L because it starts with T and has an even number of T's; TACG ∉ L because it does not start and end with the same symbol; and w =AGGA ∉ L because (#G(w) + 1)  ≠  (#A(w) + #C(w)).

G      reject, because #G + 1 ≠ #A + #C
GCA    reject, starts/ends diff symbols
GCAAG  reject, #G > 1

Is it possible for the DFA to accept a string starting with G?

AA    reject
AGCA  reject
ACA   reject
AGA    accept #A + #C = 2 = #G + 1
ATTGTA accept

T      reject, #G + 1 ≠ #A + #C

TATCGT  accept

TGACTT   accept

TCTT    accept

TATGCGT   rejcect

    TCGCTT 

    ℇ is the zero-length string

∑ = {C,A,G,T}
Strings over ∑ in lexicographic order
{ℇ,C,A,G,T,CC,CA,CG,CT,AC,AA,AG,AT … }

w = TATGCGT
w is a substring of itself, ℇ is a substring of any string

is GCG a substring of w?

 TATGCGT
    ^^^

is GTG a substring of w? no, it does not occur in w.
